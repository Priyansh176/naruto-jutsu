- **Size**: 300x300 pixels (will be resized automatically)
- **Background**: Any (transparent or solid color works)
- **Content**: Clear, high-quality image of the hand sign
- **View**: Front-facing view preferred for best recognition

## Usage

These images are displayed as reference overlays in the top-right corner during data capture, helping users form the correct hand signs.

## Where to Find Images

You can:
1. Take photos of yourself performing each hand sign
2. Find reference images online (search for "Naruto hand signs")
3. Use screenshots from the Naruto anime/manga
4. Create illustrations of the hand signs

**Note:** If an image is missing, the data capture tool will still work but won't show a reference for that gesture.
